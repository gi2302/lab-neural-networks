    "\n",
    "After loading the dataset and inspecting its contents, we performed several data engineering steps to prepare the dataset for the neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inspecting the Dataset**: \n",
    "   - The first five rows of the dataset were displayed to check the values and structure. Each row represents a game, with the first 9 columns representing the grid positions (`x`, `o`, or `b` for empty). The `class` column indicates whether Player X wins (True) or if Player O wins or the game is a draw (False).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Converting Categorical Values to Numeric**: \n",
    "   - We used Label Encoding to convert the categorical values (`x`, `o`, `b`) into numeric values. In the converted dataset, `x` became `2`, `o` became `1`, and `b` became `0`. This transformation is necessary for machine learning models, as they require numeric inputs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The first 5 rows after encoding show that the grid positions have been successfully transformed into numeric representations, and the `class` column, which indicates whether Player X wins or not, was also encoded (`1` for Player X wins, `0` for non-win scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Normalizing the Data**: \n",
    "   - The input data, which represents the game grid, was normalized. The grid values were transformed so that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This normalization ensures that no feature is disproportionately dominant in the model due to differences in scale.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The normalized input data shows values that are now within a similar range, making them ready for feeding into the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Separating Inputs and Outputs**: \n",
    "   - We separated the dataset into input features (the grid positions) and the target output (`class`). The target output is a binary value (1 for Player X wins and 0 for non-win scenarios).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output of the Data Engineering Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first 5 rows of the dataset show the game grid and the `class` column, indicating Player X's outcome.\n",
    "- After encoding, the first 5 rows of the normalized input data demonstrate how the grid values were transformed into a standardized scale.\n",
    "- The first 5 labels (output) indicate whether Player X wins (`1`) or not (`0`).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Split the Dataset:\n",
    "We split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`. The training set is used to train the model, and the test set helps evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Create the Model:\n",
    "We build a neural network model using the `Sequential` API in Keras. The model consists of the following layers:\n",
    "- **Input Layer**: The first hidden layer has 128 neurons, and we use ReLU activation. The number of input features matches the number of features in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Hidden Layers**: The model includes two additional hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, respectively, both using the ReLU activation function.\n",
    "- **Output Layer**: The output layer has 3 neurons with a softmax activation function to represent the probabilities for each class in the classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Compile the Model:\n",
    "The model is compiled with the following configurations:\n",
    "- **Optimizer**: We use the `Adam` optimizer.\n",
    "- **Loss Function**: The `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function is used for multiclass classification.\n",
    "- **Metrics**: We track accuracy during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Train the Model:\n",
    "We train the model for 50 epochs using the training data. The model learns from the data and updates its parameters accordingly to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluate the Model:\n",
    "After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the test set. We report the test loss and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Save the Model:\n",
    "Finally, we save the trained model with the `.keras` extension for future use.\n",

    "- **Training Accuracy**: The model achieved a training accuracy of 100% in the last epoch, showing near-perfect performance during training.\n",

    "1. **Added More Layers**: We added an additional hidden layer (with 16 neurons) to allow the model to learn more complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "2. **Adjusted the Learning Rate**: The learning rate for the Adam optimizer was set to 0.0005 to help improve convergence.\n",
    "3. **Increased the Number of Epochs**: The number of epochs was increased to 100 to give the model more opportunities to learn from the data and potentially achieve better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "- **Training Accuracy**: The model achieved near-perfect training accuracy of **100%** at the last epoch, indicating that it had learned the training data well.\n",
    "- **Test Accuracy**: The model's test accuracy was **91.2%**, which is a substantial improvement compared to the previous model.\n",
    "- **Test Loss**: The test loss was **0.4224**, which is acceptable given the high test accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "By adding more layers, adjusting the learning rate, and increasing the number of epochs, the model's performance on the test data was improved. However, further fine-tuning or more advanced techniques could be explored in future steps to reduce the test loss even more and improve generalization.\n"

    "## Reflection on Model Improvement Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, several approaches were explored to improve the model's performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding More Layers**: \n",
    "   - Adding additional layers helped the model to learn more complex patterns in the data, which led to better accuracy. However, more layers might not always be necessary if the data can be well-learned by the existing architecture.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Adjusting the Learning Rate**: \n",
    "   - Modifying the learning rate of the Adam optimizer to a smaller value allowed the model to converge more gradually, preventing overshooting and achieving more stable learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Increasing the Number of Epochs**: \n",
    "   - Training the model for a longer period provided more opportunities for the model to improve its learning. While the accuracy continued to improve, there was a point where it reached near perfection, showing diminishing returns on further training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Helpful Approach:\n",
    "The most helpful approach was **adjusting the learning rate** and **increasing the number of epochs**. These allowed the model to refine its predictions, improve its performance on the test data, and avoid overfitting. Adding more layers also contributed, but with diminishing returns beyond a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions:\n",
    "To further improve performance, techniques such as regularization, tuning hyperparameters like batch size, or using advanced architectures (like CNNs or RNNs) could be explored depending on the problem at hand.\n"
